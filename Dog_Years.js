// This JS app converts human age into dog years //

// Declare variables
// Declare a constant variable for my human age 
const myAge = 55;

// Declare a flexible variable for early years
let earlyYears = 2;

// Multiply 'early years' by 10.5 
earlyYears *= 10.5;

// Subtract 2 from 'myAge' 
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
